# Zeebe gateway configuration file

# Overview -------------------------------------------

# This file contains a complete list of available configuration options.

# Default values:
#
# When the default value is used for a configuration option, the option is
# commented out. You can learn the default value from this file

# Conventions:
#
# Byte sizes
# For buffers and others must be specified as strings and follow the following
# format: "10U" where U (unit) must be replaced with K = Kilobytes, M = Megabytes or G = Gigabytes.
# If unit is omitted then the default unit is simply bytes.
# Example:
# sendBufferSize = "16M" (creates a buffer of 16 Megabytes)
#
# Time units
# Timeouts, intervals, and the likes, must be specified as strings and follow the following
# format: "VU", where:
#   - V is a numerical value (e.g. 1, 1.2, 3.56, etc.)
#   - U is the unit, one of: ms = Millis, s = Seconds, m = Minutes, or h = Hours
#
# Paths:
# Relative paths are resolved relative to the installation directory of the
# gateway.

[network]

# This section contains the network configuration. Particularly, it allows to
# configure the hosts and ports the gateway should bind to.

# Controls the default host the gateway should bind to.
#
# This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_GATEWAY_HOST.
# host = "0.0.0.0"

# Sets the port the gateway binds to.
#
# This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_GATEWAY_PORT.
# port = 26500

[cluster]

# This sections contains the configuration to connect to a cluster of Zeebe brokers.

# Set the contact point of one of the Zeebe brokers in the cluster
#
# This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_GATEWAY_CONTACT_POINT.
# contactPoint = "127.0.0.1:26501"

# Set the size of the buffer used to handle request/responses from the Zeebe broker cluster
# sendBufferSize = "2M"

# Set the request timeout for requests to any of the Zeebe brokers in the cluster
# requestTimeout = "15s"

[threads]

# This sections contains the configuration of the number of threads to use by the gateway.

# Set the number of management threads to handle request/responses to the Zeebe broker cluster
# managementThreads = 1
